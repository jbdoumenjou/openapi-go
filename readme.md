This repository contains experiments on [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) V3.1.0 Spec.

# Goals

* The first step is to understand the OAS structure and provide all Objects from the 3.1.0 specification.
* Then, playing with (de)serialization and validation/rules.
* Then, providing tool like a test helper to check that all the specified API are effectively tested in a Go project.
